        <p>What follows is a list of stories which are not only good but have gone above and beyond being just good stories and have spoken to some deeply felt aspects of life. These stories stay with you long after you've read them and pay off re-reading with newer depths and meanings. I must say, the first and the last on the list made the greatest impression on me.</p>
